# My solution to Assignment 2

Project 2, Car Soccer

The main thing I found unusual about my project is when the ball collides with
the car it will not travel on the x-axis. The ball will still bounce but the
collision with the car will not cause it to travel any other way except along
the z-axis.

I managed to get all of the parts working except for the realistic driving
model. The car will not turn as intended. The ball will react with all the
surfaces and will reset the game if it hits one of the goals. Gravity does act
on the ball which will eventually cause it to come to a reset. The ball also
loses 20% of it's energy when it bounces of a surface.

I did not attempt any wizard work this time.
